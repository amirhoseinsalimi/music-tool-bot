# Music Tool Bot

The one and only Telegram bot you want to manage your music and MP3 files. Check it out here:
[@MusicToolBot](https://t.me/MusicToolBot)

Supports 2 languages for now: **English** and **Persian**. ([Add more if you want](#contribution))

### Requirements to run this bot

1. Python 3.8 (Preferably)
2. ffmpeg
3. `venv` and `pipenv`
4. Optionally you can install `pm2` (globally) which is a Node.js module to manage processes. Since `pm2` can also
   manage Python processes, I use it to run the bot in production. No Node.js/JavaScript knowledge is required. Just
   install `pm2` and run convenient script runners using pipenv. If you want to run the bot using other process
   managers, that's fine.

5. **Set up the database:**<br />
   This bot persists the IDs of users and admins in a SQLite database. So you need to create a database followed by 
   running migrations:<br />
   `pipenv run db:migrate`.<br />
   Then run seeds to populate the `admins` table with an owner-level 
   access:<br />
   `pipenv run db:seed`.

6. **Run the bot**<br />
   a. Start the bot `pipenv run start`<br />
   b. Restart the bot `pipenv run restart`<br /><br />
   
See below for all possible commands:
| Command `pipenv run <command>`   | Description                                                                                |

# Contribution

At the beginning I had written this bot in JavaScript, but due to lack of quality packages, it was full of bugs. Then I
decided to learn Python and thought: **Why not re-write @MusicToolBot in Python?** And then I began to revive the
project. <br />

This tiny bot is my first practical Python project. I tried to learn Python along with coding, so I could better wrap my
head around the syntax and the built-in functionality of the language. However, as a novice Python developer, I know
this bot can be written in a more smart way with better code structure. So, if you know Python, I will really appreciate
any help to make this kid better. My main concern is the application structure, but please feel free to create PRs, open
discussions and make small fixes (like typos). In addition, I got some plans and features for this bot, you can find 
them [in TODOS file](https://github.com/amirhoseinsalimi/music-tool-bot/blob/master/TODOS) or the 
[issue board](https://github.com/amirhoseinsalimi/music-tool-bot/issues). Also, I'd be very appreciated if you can 
translate the bot to your language.
